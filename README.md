# Description

My personnal repository for solving the advent of code puzzles.

You can check the puzzles at https://adventofcode.com/

## Solutions format

A different directory is made for each year I solved. 

A directory contains the source code for each day, and maybe additionnal files. The scripts (or compiled executables depending of the language) open a text file "puzzle.txt" containing the respective day's puzzle, and prints a solution on the standard output, with the exception of some esoteric solutions that involve, for example, outputting the puzzle in a graphic format.

To follow the rules of the event, the said text files are not included within the repository
